Project Overview
----------------

This is the 4th version of the program and the first in which we have implemented JavaScript and webview. The previous versions were based on Python and required to be run on the terminal. With this new version, we have enhanced the user interface as well as added some features. Our goal is to help everyone improve their mental calculation skills. We have included a mode to train and a mode to play. The training mode will help you practice in a way tailored to your needs. Whereas the play mode will challenge you with different operations at one time.
