Hello user!!
This is the README file for the program: "3_release_TdM_final.py".

Instructions:
For using or running the file you need to have a python coding environment. You can download the official python IDLE in this link: python.org. Once installed, open the python IDLE and open the file (Ctrl+O, Cmd+O). Now you can click on "F5" and the game will start. If have any problems please contact me (see GitHub porfile). Thank you for using this program, I hope you enjoy it.


Story:
All began with the first release, a basic python coded module that can help practicing multiplications from 1 to 10. But this code had some bugs and some extra things could be added.

A better update was the second release. This release enabled to select a language (English or Spanish) and to choose the lowest and highest values. The backend system was however very simple.

So the third release came, the best of all three and the one you have downloaded. This release fixes all existing bugs of the system using functions. It introduces the training and gaming modes and allows you to practice or play with three arithmetic operators (+,-,*). It also changes the previous '0' command to a 'q' for preventing confusion and ables you to use integer division on the training mode. And it can be used in three different languages, English, Spanish and Catalan.

And if you are wondering what the name "TdM" means, it stays for "Tablas de Multiplicar".
